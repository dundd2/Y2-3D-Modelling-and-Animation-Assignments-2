# Y2-3D-Modelling-and-Animation-Assignments-2

This is a 3D animation project created for the G6079: 3D Modelling and Animation Assignment 2 in May 2025. For more information please check the Assignment 2 Requitrement and Grade PDF file.

This repository showcases my 3D animation skills through Cinema 4D projects: a **Bouncing Ball Animation (Week 7)** and the main **Lamp Character Animation (Assignment 2)**. These projects demonstrate proficiency in character animation, emotion portrayal, and storytelling through animation.

## Assignment 2: 3D Animation Project with Character Performance and Foundational Principles

This comprehensive project encompasses both foundational animation exercises and advanced character animation, demonstrating progression from basic principles to complex storytelling through movement.

### Project Components

- **Bouncing Ball Animation (Week 7)**: Foundational exercise implementing core animation principles including squash and stretch, timing and spacing, and realistic motion physics using Cinema 4D.
  
- **Lamp Character Animation**: 30-second character performance featuring a rigged lamp model with emotional storytelling, creating a clear narrative of a lamp jumping over tables.
  
- **Emotional Storytelling**: Portrayed multiple emotions through animation techniques, bringing personality to the lamp character through movement and timing.
  
- **Complex Movements**: Implemented challenging jump sequences and character interactions with environmental objects.
  
- **Pre-production Planning**: Created detailed storyboards and video acting reference to plan timing and key poses for professional workflow.
  
- **Technical Specifications**: Delivered final animation as H.264 MP4 at 1920x1080, 25fps, meeting all technical requirements.

### This comprehensive project demonstrates:

- **Fundamental to Advanced Animation**: Progression from basic principles (bouncing ball) to complex character performance.
  
- **Cinema 4D Proficiency**: Effective use of keyframes, timeline, animation curves, and rigging manipulation.
  
- **Storytelling Through Animation**: Creating narrative and emotional connection through movement and timing.
  
- **Professional Workflow**: Complete animation pipeline from pre-production planning to final delivery.

**Grade**: 63/100 

**Assessment Summary**: The submission demonstrated good key poses and narrative structure, with detailed planning materials including storyboard and pre-visualization video. Areas for improvement included timing refinement, particularly in jump sequences and air-time duration. The bouncing ball showed solid understanding of fundamental principles. For detailed feedback, please refer to the grade PDF document.

The project files for both animations are available within this repository. Feel free to explore the Cinema 4D project files, rendered animations, and planning documentation. This project demonstrates my ability to design, plan, and execute character animations with emotional storytelling using industry-standard 3D animation software.
